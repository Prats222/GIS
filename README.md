# Object proximity alert system using GIS


"Object proximity alert system using GIS" is an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) project that leverages various technologies to create interactive maps and geospatial applications. It is built using OpenLayers, GeoServer, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, jQuery, and MongoDB.

## Overview

GIS is designed to provide powerful geospatial capabilities, allowing users to visualize, analyze, and interact with geographic data. Whether you need to display maps, perform spatial analysis, or manage geospatial data, GIS is a versatile solution.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenLayers:** GIS uses OpenLayers to render interactive maps and provide a seamless mapping experience.

- **GeoServer:** GeoServer serves as the back-end geospatial server, enabling data publication and sharing through standardized web services.

- **JavaScript:** The project extensively relies on JavaScript for building the user interface, handling map interactions, and client-side scripting.

- **Bootstrap:** Bootstrap is used for responsive web design, ensuring that GIS-BEL works well on various devices and screen sizes.

- **HTML:** HTML is the backbone of the project, providing the structure for web pages and the basis for rendering content.

- **jQuery:** jQuery enhances the user experience by providing dynamic and interactive elements in the application.

- **Tomcat:** Tomcat serves as the web server for hosting the GIS-BEL application.

- **MongoDB:** MongoDB is used for storing and managing geospatial data, allowing for efficient retrieval and storage.

## Features

- Interactive map display with layers and markers.
- Spatial data querying and analysis.
- Geospatial data storage and retrieval.
- User-friendly web interface.

## Installation

To run GIS locally with Tomcat and GeoServer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Prats222/GIS.git
cd GIS


2. Configure your Tomcat and GeoServer settings as needed.

3. Deploy the application to your Tomcat server.

4. Access the GIS application through your web browser at `http://localhost:8080/GIS` (or the appropriate address and port).

## Usage

To use GIS, follow these steps:

1. Access the GIS application through your web browser.

2. Explore the map, interact with layers, and perform spatial queries.

3. Use the navigation tools to pan and zoom on the map.

4. Analyze geospatial data as needed.
